##  Personal Repo to study Rust <a target="_blank" href="#"><img height="30" src="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/img/rust-logo-blk.svg"></a> :) 


My name is **Brenno Machado** and on this repo I'll try to annotate my learning days with The Rust Programming Language and summarize what I learn on that day.  
You can see more about me on: <a href="https://github.com/brennomachado"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-GitHub-100000?logo=github&logoColor=white&style=flat" /></a>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennomachado/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0077B5?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white&style=flat"/></a> 

- I'll use, mostly, 3 references to learn:
    - ["the book" of The Rust Programing Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
    - Online courses: 
        - [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-lang/) by Dmitri Nesteruk (Udemy)
        - [Rust Programming For Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-coding-for-beginners) by Jayson Lennon (Udemy)
        - [Rust: Linguaguem de Programação Performática e Segura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/rust-linguagem-programacao-performatica-segura), by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br) (a Brazilian code school)

 - Day 01: I read chapter 1, 2 and 3 of [the book]((https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)), and I set up my vscode to code with Rust. I also watched videos (until section 2) about types, variables, consts, functions of Dmitri's and Alura's course. Basically a little introduction of the Rust and some syntax differences.
